# Perceptron

The perceptron is a supervised Machine Learning algorithm used for classifications tasks, it was first invented in 1958 by Frank Rosenblatt, funded by the US Office of Naval Research. It was first implemented in the IBM 704 for image recognition problems. It set the ball rolling in this science field.

Since 1958, many variations where developed. Here, 3 of them have been developed:

* The vanilla perceptron: It is the most primitive and basic algorithm. So as to ensure its converge, data is to be linearly separably. It is the basic unit for neural networks.
* The voted and averaged perceptron: Date does not need to be linearly separably.

**Warning**: These algorithms have been here implemented with the aim of illustrate the essence of them, rather than with the purpose of solving a real ML problem. That is why algorithm is tested with training data.
